## Update in relation to COVIDâ€‘19
According to the policy of South Korea government and KAIST against the COVID-19 spreading throughout the nation, we have decided to deliver a lecture online for the first two weeks. For students who have trouble due to the postponed course closing, please refer to the notice in KLMS **after the semester starts.**


## Additional Registration
> This section is only for those who failed at registering this course on the system. If succeeded already, you can take this course no matter which department you belong to.

> We will not reply to any emails about course registration. 

Considering a huge demand for this course, we decide to **only** accept addtional registration from **1st or 2nd year MS/MS-PhD/PhD students at School of Computing. There will be no exceptions/changes in our policy.** When applicable, you should apply for course addition in the Academic System from March 10. The professor will approve your requests on a daily basis. The registration from every other students will not be approved (e.g. undergraduate students, graduate students in EE and AI). We ask for your kind understanding regarding this matter.
